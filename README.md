> 5. If you have never used Prism and this is your first mod, press add instance in the top left corner of prism launcher, select minecraft version 1.21.1, and scroll down to choose your mod loader where you will select fabric, once you click fabric it will generate a list of versions to select, choose fabric 0.16.10 or higher for best results. I built the mod for 0.16.10.
> 6. Press Ok, it should bring you back to the main menu of the prism launcher and you should now see block that says 1.21.1. click on that and press run on the right hand side of the panel.
> 7. This will start up minecraft and generate the mods folder you need to drop your jar in. once you hit the main menu of minecraft you can exit.
> 8. go back to the prism launcher main menu select the same block but this time instead of pressing launch press folder on the right hand panel. from there open the minecraft folder, open the mods folder, and drop  the mod jar into the folder. Congrats, you've now installed the furniture mod!
