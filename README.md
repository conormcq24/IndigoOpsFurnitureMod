If you have never used Prism and this is your first mod, press add instance in the top left corner of prism launcher, select minecraft version 1.21.1, and scroll down to choose your mod loader where you will select fabric, once you click fabric it will generate a list of versions to select, choose fabric 0.16.10 or higher for best results. I built the mod for 0.16.10.

#### Description
>
>Tables are a necessity for good interior decoration and minecraft has been lacking in this staple of a dining area for quite some time. When you craft the table and place it it will have no table cloth, you can place a table cloth on its surface by right clicking with a carpet of any color. This will take the carpet from your hand and feed it into the table as a table cloth that matches the color of the carpet you've spent. you can use shears to remove the table cloth, another carpet to update it, and if you break the table it will give you back any carpet you've placed on it.

#### Description
>
>You simply cannot have a table without a chair! Similarly to the tables cloth the chair has a coushin which can be changed with a right click when a carpet is in your hand. The main difference is that the chair spawns with a default white coushin. Using a shear on a colored coushin will simply revert it back to white. Breaking Shearing and Replacing a white coushin will not give you back a white carpet to prevent duplication glitches, but any other color will.
